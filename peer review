Peer's repository:  https://github.com/ToxiicMarker/Galagunk.git



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
I leanred how they were able to add copies of the same sprite to appear like lives and how to get text on screen.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I wanted to put text on my screen, but couldn't remebmer how. Looking at their code on lines 158-161 shows me the correct code.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I can't make suggestions for improvement when theirs was more complicated than my own. I guess I chose to lower the ammount of shots it takes to kill an enemy because I didn't like how long it took, but that's really a personal choice.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
It was commented fine, I could understand the functionality of all the code they added.
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
on line 107, their enemy x quardinate had "120 * (i+1) + 40." I had no idea what that changed about the quardinate.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Perhaps explaining the specifics of the stars file and what was used to make it run.
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
You did a lot of work to make this really look like a galaga-esque game. I liked the extra sprites in the corners that looked like extra lives and the animation in the background.
